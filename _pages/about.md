Hi! I'm Wentao Chen (陈文韬 in Chinese).

I'm a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at **UCSD**, co-advised by [Prof. Rajesh K. Gupta](https://mesl.ucsd.edu/gupta/index.html) and [Prof. Jingbo Shang](https://shangjingbo1226.github.io/). Previously, I received my B.E. from [ACM class](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home), **Shanghai Jiao Tong University**.

## Research Interests

My research interest includes natural language proccessing and machine learning. To be specific, 

- **LLM code generation**: Improve the performance and align LLM with real-world production scenarios. This can be achieved by prompting/RL/...
- **Time Series Adaptation**: Extract better features from time series data and try to find a unified architecture for TS-LLM.

I am activately looking for collaborators on these areas. Feel free to contact me!

## Education

- PhD in Computer Science and Engineering, [UCSD](https://ucsd.edu/), 2025-
- B.E. in Computer Science and Engineering, [ACM class](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home), [Zhiyuan College](https://en.zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/), [SJTU](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), 2021-2025

## Experience

- Summer Internship in UCSD, working with [Prof. Jingbo Shang](https://shangjingbo1226.github.io/) on LLM attacks and code generation memorization. 
- Internship in [BCMI lab](https://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/), SJTU with [Prof. Weilong Zheng](https://weilongzheng.github.io/) on self-supervised EEG learning on emotion classification.

Here is my [CV](../files/CV.pdf).
