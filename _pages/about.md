Hi! I'm Wentao Chen, a junior student of [ACM class](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home), Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My research interest includes natural language proccessing and machine learning, especially logic reasoning of LLM.

One of my research experiences involved remote collaboration with [Prof. Diyi Yang](https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/), where I contributed to a project on LLM unlearning alongside a PhD and a Bachelor. Additionally, I have worked in [the BCMI lab](https://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/) at SJTU under the guidance of [Prof. Baoliang Lu](https://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/~blu/), exploring self-supervised learning on SEED datasets. 

My technical proficiency includes C/C++, Python (with expertise in PyTorch and Huggingface).

Here is my [CV](../assets/CV.pdf).
