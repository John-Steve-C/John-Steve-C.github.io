Hi! I'm Wentao Chen, an fourth-year undergraduate student of [ACM class](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home), Shanghai Jiao Tong University. And I'm applying for a Ph.D. in 2025 Fall.

## Research Interests

My research interest includes natural language proccessing and machine learning. To be specific, 

- **LLM Safety**: How can we ensure LLMs do not produce harmful responses or compromise privacy?
- **Representation Learning**: How can we extract superior representations from plain text or sequential data to enhance downstream task performance?
- **Logic Reasoning**: There should be something better than Chain-of-Thought.

For now, I'm working with [Prof. Jingbo Shang](https://shangjingbo1226.github.io/) on LLM attacks and code generation memorization. Before, I have worked in SJTU BCMI with [Prof. Weilong Zheng](https://weilongzheng.github.io/) on self-supervised EEG learning on emotion classification.

My technical proficiency includes C/C++, Python (with expertise in PyTorch and Huggingface).

Here is my [CV](../files/CV.pdf). (Please ignore the top button)
